# Exploration-of-the-Image-Processing-techniques-to-grade-rice-based-on-the-percentage-of-damaged-kernel
This work is a part of COMP9517 Computer Vision subject @UNSW 2020

We performed the following tasks (refer to report for details):
## Task1:
Implementation of Iso-data Intensity Thresholding to separate background and foreground in given rice images (greyscale images). The images have a bimodal pixel intensity histogram. 

## Task2: 
Implementation of two-pass connected components labeling algorithm to count the rice kernels in each image.

## Task3: 

Calculate the percentage of damaged rice kernels using minimum pixel area as a threshold from the connected component labels obtained in Task2.
